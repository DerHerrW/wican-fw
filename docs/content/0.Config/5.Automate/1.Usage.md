# Automate

The "Automate" feature can be used to **periodically request one or more PID**s and post the results to an **MQTT server**. Therefore, this feature requires [MQTT configured in WiCAN](../MQTT.md).

Configuration of "Automate" is done on the "Automate" tab.  

## Vehicle Profiles
The "Automate" feature automatically downloads **vehicle profiles** from GitHub containing some popular PIDs (e.g. SoC, SoH). These vehicle profiles are car vendor and/or model specific. There is a growing [list of supported vehicles](2.Supported_Vehicles.md).

If WiCAN cannot download vehicles profiles for any reason you man also [download in manually](https://github.com/meatpiHQ/wican-fw/blob/main/vehicle_profiles.json) and press the `Choose File` button to select the file downloaded.

In order to use vehicle profiles `Vehicle Specific` has to be set to `Enable`.

If vehicles profiles are available to WiCAN the appropriate `Vehicle Model` should be selected from the drop-down box. Use the reload button next to it to trigger the download of the most up-to-date vehicle profiles.

In `Cycle Time(ms)` the interval is configured after which the PIDs, contained in the vehicle profile, are requested. 

The results are posted to the MQTT topic specified in `Destination Topic`.

## Custom PIDs

If there is no vehicle profile for your car, or it does not contain the PIDs you would like to use, the "Custom PIDs" feature should be used. Basically you can enter the same parameters contained in the vehicle profiles:

- **Custom Initialisation**: will be sent by WiCAN prior requesting particular PIDs
- **Name**: the attribute name containing the result of the PID request
- **Init**: will be sent by WiCAN prior requesting this particular PID
- **Expression**: is used to calculate the attribute value from the bytes returned for this PID
- **Period**: the interval after which this PID is requested again
- **Type**: currently only `MQTT_Topic` can be selected
- **Send_to**: the MQTT topic the result should be sent to

In order to add more PIDs the `New` button can be used.
The `Delete` button deletes the configuration of the corresponding PID 

In order to use Custom PIDs `Vehicle Specific` has to be set to `Disable`.
