## Configuring WiFi

Your WiCAN will broadcast its own Access Point, that you can connect to. It will be called `WiCAN_xxxxxxx`. You can connect to it with the default password `@meatpi#`.

If you are using a phone, you may need to wait a few seconds and confirm you want to connect to a network that does not provide internet.

Once connected you can go to `192.168.80.1` in your browser to get to the WiCAN settings.

From there you can go to the `Settings` tab to change `Mode` to AP+Station, and input your home `SSID` and `Password`. Once saved you can check the `Status` tab to see your WiCAN `Station IP`. Once you have the station IP, you can connect your phone from the WiCAN AP to your regular home WiFi, and go to the `Station IP` you just got from the Status tab. This should show you the same website as you saw earlier. Congradulations you now have your WiCAN connected to home WiFi.
